#this uses the Dfam-RepeatMasker.lib.gz file from the dfam website to create a custom TE library, reducing the amount of unknowns in the repeatlandscape graph

#download dfam library specifically curated for repeatmasker
wget https://dfam.org/releases/Dfam_3.8/families/Dfam-RepeatMasker.lib.gz

#file saved as Dfam-RepeatMasker.lib.gz, unable to view (is red when downloaded)

#unzip file using gunzip (for .gz files), is no longer red
gunzip Dfam-RepeatMasker.lib.gz

#combine downloaded dfam library with already built database file from repeatmodeler.
cat aurelia_aurita_db Dfam-RepeatMasker.lib.gz > combined_TE_library.fasta

#build a database that RepeatMasker can use from the newly combined library
BuildDatabase -name combined_TE_library_db combined_TE_library.fasta

#use database as input in repeatmasker
